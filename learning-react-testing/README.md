Testing the tests for testing.

Okay, I'll be more descriptive than that.  I'm trying to learn React Testing Library and Jest to write tests for a separate project, so this is the playground to learn how to do that.  If you're here looking for something useful, you're not likely to find much, I'm pretty much following [this tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-library/) step-by-step, ideally in a way that makes it easy for me to reference back if I have a question about "oh I encountered this, how did that work?"

I am by no means an expert on Jest/React Testing Library, but if you stumbled across this because you're looking for help, feel free to raise an issue on here and I'll try to get you going in the right direction!

If you stubled across this because you're @MicahWW... hey, how's it going? ðŸ˜‰
